Source: TradingView Bitcoin RSI returns to key support Data from  Cointelegraph Markets Pro  and  TradingView  shows BTC/USD currently acting around $66,000 after falling 5% in a single hourly candle. Bitcoin may be down 7% in April, but a retest of support is already having a cathartic effect on overheated markets. As Cointelegraph reported, with the latest drop came a  major liquidation event  — one which, at the time of writing, totaled $400 million for Bitcoin and altcoins combined. With it, per data from monitoring resource  CoinGlass , funding rates started turning negative. “Prices are pushing lower, and funding rates plummet as a result,” popular trader Jelle  commented  in a post on X. “BTC & ETH margined contracts already into the negatives. All leverage must be destroyed before price discovery.” Crypto funding rate heatmap (screenshot). Source: CoinGlass In the latest edition of its “Asia Morning Color” market updates sent to Telegram channel subscribers, trading firm QCP Capital acknowledged the significant change in the funding landscape. “The speed of the move was due to large liquidations on retail-heavy exchanges like Binance which saw perp funding rates go from as high as 77% to flat,” it wrote, adding that “the move brings spot prices right back into the middle the 60-72k range.” “While perp funding has compressed, the rest of the forward curve remains very elevated,” it added.  “Will this be the move that brings the whole curve back down?” At the same time, Bitcoin’s relative strength index (RSI) readings on daily timeframes are back at the 50 midpoint. This is an important line in the sand during uptrends, and its preservation has characterized Bitcoin  since the end of January . Bitcoin, as Jelle, among others, notes, delivers its strongest performance with an RSI above 70 — corresponding to an “overbought” signal for price. BTC/USD 1-day chart with RSI data.
